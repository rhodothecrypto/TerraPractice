# Playground Scripts

This directory contains short scripts that call into the Terra blockchain.

This gives you more flexibility than using the Terrain framework. Feel free to
modify existing scripts or add new ones.

The examples at https://docs.terra.money/docs/develop/sdks/terra-js/common-examples.html can be pretty handy.
